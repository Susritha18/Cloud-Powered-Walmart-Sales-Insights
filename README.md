This is my "Walmart Sales Analytics Project" in real time! Constructed with Python, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, GCP Pub/Sub, and Google Looker Studio.

Project Insights:
Python Enchantment: Producing fictitious inventory changes and sales transactions, then posting them to Pub/Sub topics.

Double Pub/Sub: Sharing information across several Pub/Sub topics, each of which turns on a specific Cloud Function.

Cloud functions : Includes responding to Pub/Sub events and importing data into BigQuery for thorough analysis by extracting and integrating it from the stream using a Python script.

Real-time inventory maintenance : It involves updating inventory data in real-time as soon as a transaction is generated, ensuring synced data for accurate stock levels and enhanced sales analysis.

Unleashing Google Looker Studio: Using Google Looker Studio to visualize data and offer Store Sales Comparison,Unit Price Distribution by Category, Quantity Distribution Across Stores, Sales Count by Product Category sales reports with dynamic visuals for insights that can be put to use.
